<h1 align="center">Workify: Your Working Classify </h1>

## Introduction

Our group plans to create an app called Workify, designed to help people recognize their limits at work and manage their schedules effectively. Workify includes several useful features, such as a calendar, reminder alarms, an energy tracker, and stress-reduction recommendations. Time management is often challenging due to a lack of awareness about the value of time, energy, and mindset, leading to feelings of overwhelm and burnout. By organizing work schedules and promoting mental clarity, Workify aims to prevent burnout and improve productivity. According to James, Horne, and John (2005), effective time management involves assessing time, setting goals, planning, prioritizing, and monitoring. Workify addresses these principles by helping users identify, prioritize, and monitor their tasks, ultimately aiding those struggling with packed and disorganized schedules.
